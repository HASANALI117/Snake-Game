## Overview

Snake is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that is trying to eat as much food as possible. The snake starts out small, but it grows longer every time it eats a piece of food. If the snake hits itself or the edge of the screen, the game is over. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.

The snake game is a simple game, but it is very addictive. It is a great game for people of all ages, and it is a great way to pass the time.
